Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) are foundational practices in modern DevOps, enabling automated testing, rapid feedback, and reliable software deployment. This lab focuses on configuring Jenkins, a leading automation server, to establish CI/CD pipelines for a Java-based Binary Calculator application. The objectives include exploring Jenkins' pipeline syntax, setting up automated builds using Maven projects, and designing declarative pipelines via Jenkinsfiles.
